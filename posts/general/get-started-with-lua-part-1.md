I've been noticing that how to get started with Lua is a really common question on Lua's subreddit and other community channels such as one of our Telegram groups. 
Often the reply to this question is "Read the Programming in Lua book" or "Fiddle with LÖVE framework". 
I absolutely recommend PiL, it's not just an excellent resource but a great read on programming in general. 
However, my issue with this suggestion is that it's a rather lengthy / detailed read, 
and not everyone is willing to go through it just to get a general overview of the language. 
Starting a mini-game on LÖVE is also a great idea for those who are comfortable with learning by just poking around things, 
but for those who prefer a more structured guide, it could be rather vague.

I've given some talks about this theme before, 
so I decided to re-organise that material with some increments and make a series of posts about it. 
This series is intended for people who already program in other languages and are interested in knowming more about Lua.
